#In this code,nfirst handle the special case of overflow where the dividend is the minimum integer and 
#the divisor is -1. In this case, the quotient is the maximum integer.
#then convert both the dividend and divisor to their positive equivalents to simplify the division process. We initialize the quotient and remainder to 0.
#then perform bit manipulation to compute the quotient. 
#loop over the bits of the dividend from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. 
#shift the divisor by each bit and add it to the remainder if it is less than or equal to the dividend. 
#set the corresponding bit in the quotient if the condition is true.

#Finally, determine the sign of the quotient based on the signs of the dividend and divisor. 
#If the dividend and divisor have opposite signs, the quotient is negative. Otherwise, it is positive.
